# DeathShuffle
 
Minecraft Plugin Minigame

All players are given a random way to die, and they must try and die that way before 5 minutes (editable in config) is up. The first player unable to complete their death task loses. Note that keep inventory is automatically turned on when a new game begins. Credit for this idea goes entirely to Dream on YouTube. Leave a review if you enjoy the plugin!
